<p>A conviction for operating a vehicle while intoxicated is not a minor traffic offense.  Operating While Intoxicated is a criminal conviction that will become part of your permanent criminal record. The offense generally is charged as a class A misdemeanor. A class A misdemeanor is punishable by up to 1 year in prison and a $5,000 fine. The court can impose a license suspension of up to two years. A class C misdemeanor is punishable by up to 60 days in jail, and a $500 fine. Furthermore, it if is your 2nd offense within 5 years, or if there is an accident involving serious bodily injury, Operating While Intoxicated will be charged as a class D felony which is punishable by 6 months to 3 years incarceration and a $10,000 fine. Additionally, if you accumulate 3 convictions within a 10 year period, you may lose your license for 10 years. In some cases a conviction for operating while intoxicated statutorily requires mandatory jail time. (This is not an all-inclusive list of the possible penalties). Accordingly, if you are arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, even if it is your first offense, it is very important that you contact an attorney immediately.</p>

<p>Smock and Etling has vast experience in handling alcohol and drug related arrests, and especially driving while intoxicated cases. The firm believes that it is important that you know what to expect if you are pulled over and are suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol. First and foremost, the State must have a reasonable suspicion that you are intoxicated, or that you have committed some other crime or infraction prior to pulling your vehicle over. Usually, the officer will state that you drove left of center, swerved or committed some other traffic offense in order to justify stopping your vehicle. The officer will then approach your vehicle, and if he smells alcohol, or observes your eyes to be watery or bloodshot, or that your speech is slurred, he may ask you to exit the vehicle. The officer will be watching closely to observe any difficulty you have exiting the vehicle, and also will note that as evidence of intoxication. Normally, once the driver is out of the vehicle, the officer will ask the individual to perform field sobriety tests. These tests may consist of the walk and turn, finger to nose, one leg stand, horizontal gaze nystagmus, backward count, or finger count. You will be expected to follow the directions of the officer, and perform the tests as instructed. The officer will reflect your failure to follow the officer's instructions or failure to satisfactorily complete the field sobriety tests in his report, and, again he will attempt to characterize this evidence as evidence of intoxication, in order to attempt to establish probable cause for your arrest.</p>

<p>After completing the field sobriety tests, the officer will probably request that the driver submit to an alcosensor / portable breathalyser test. This test result is not admissible as evidence of intoxication at trial, however the result may be used against the driver in order to establish the probable cause necessary to have the driver transported to the police station to submit to a certified breath test, and in some cases, to the hospital for a urine or blood test.</p>

<p>In Indiana, if your blood alcohol content registers .08 or more, the law considers this as prima facie evidence of intoxication. Additionally, even without a BAC result, you may be convicted of a Class A Misdemeanor if the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that you were intoxicated at the time you operated a motor vehicle.</p>

<p>It is also important to know that Indiana implied consent law provides for an automatic one (1) year license suspension if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood or urine test to determine your BAC, if it is suspected that you are operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Implied consent means that when you operate a motor vehicle in Indiana, you impliedly consent to submit to a chemical test.</p>

<p>Again, remember that operating a vehicle while intoxicated is a criminal offense with serious consequences. You will have a criminal record if convicted, so please consult with an attorney before going to court.</p></td>

    <td><h2 id="personal">PERSONAL INJURY</h2>
<p>Over the years, the law firm of Smock and Etling has handled product liability, medical malpractice and personal injury cases including automobile accidents, dog bites, and slip and fall cases. The firm takes great pride in putting their combined experience to work for clients injured as a result of the negligence of another person or corporation. Initially, the firm will attempt to negotiate with the insurance company to reach a settlement that will fully compensate the client for their loss. However, if the insurance company is unwilling to provide full and adequate compensation, the firm will not hesitate to file suit and, if necessary, take your case to trial.</p>

<p>If you are in an accident and you are injured, it is important that you contact an attorney as soon as possible. It is no secret that the insurance adjustor on the other side of the case will attempt to take your recorded statement at the first opportunity. You should never give a recorded statement without first contacting a lawyer. Insurance companies use recorded statements to their advantage when an unsuspecting victim accidentally forgets to include something important in their statement. The insurance adjustor on the other side may try to get you to settle sooner, rather than later, in an effort to minimize the amount of the settlement. To say the least, you should almost never settle a personal injury case before you are done treating with your doctor. The adjustor will also require you to sign a release of all claims, if you settle your case, which means if something comes up later, you will not be able to collect from the insurance company as you will have already released the insurance company from any and all additional liability.</p>

<p>A personal injury claim is based on the legal theory of negligence. Negligence generally means that a person has failed to exercise reasonable care not to injure those people around him. A person that does not exercise reasonable care and causes somebody to become injured is guilty of negligence if his actions proximately caused the injuries complained of by the party bringing a claim. Examples of negligence include, but are not limited to, causing an automobile accident or causing someone to become injured on your property by failing to maintain it in a reasonably safe manner.</p>

<p>The victim of a personal injury is, by law, entitled to collect monetary damages for present and future medical expenses related to the accident, lost wages, loss of earning capacity, pain and suffering, and future pain and suffering. Without the assistance of a lawyer, it is unlikely you will achieve maximum recovery. Again, it is important if you are injured in an accident that you contact an attorney immediately.</p></td>
